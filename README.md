# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition
- In this Project, I created a recurrent neural network and trained it on a tweet emotion data set (https://github.com/dair-ai/emotion_dataset).
- The dataset has preprocessed tweet data classified into 6 emotions: Sadness, Surprise, Joy, Anger, Love, Fear  
- The trained neural network is used to recognize emotions in tweets.
- TensorFlow is used as machine learning framework.


The modle achieved an accuracy of 0.87, and for the prediction, the confusion matrix is as follow:
